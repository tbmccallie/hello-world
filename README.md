# hello-world
====================
My name is Trenton and I'm new to the computer programming world! I've always been interested in programming, but I never delved into it on my own or in college. I just knew that I was very interested in computers and how they run, which started when I was a kid playing video games and wondering how they work.
Now that I have graduated college and have been working in wealth management since 2016, I have been introduced to the FinTech world, which piqued my interest in computer programming even futher.
I recently took the plunge into this world by starting to learn Python and decided I needed to go ahead and make a GitHub account. The more I learn, the more excited I am to continue learning!
